# config4python
Config4star http://www.config4star.org/ support in python

This was intended to be a partial implementation, supporting only basic functionality (reading and writing configs, without diving into full feature set of config4star). If you need it to do more things feel free to contribute. The final objective of this is unclear, but feel free to submit anything you need supported.
